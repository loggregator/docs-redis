## <a id="3-2-0"></a> v3.2.0

**Release Date: April 17th, 2023**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Service Gateway Access** Service-gateway access enables a VMware Redis for Tanzu Application Service on-demand service instance to connect to external components that are not on the same foundation as the service instance. These components could be on another foundation or hosted outside of the foundation.

* **Backups for AWS S3 with CA Certificate** When selecting AWS S3 as the desired option for backups, the connection can be now verified with a CA Certificate entered by the user.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Single AZ only:** Made the necessary adjustments to the cf-redis-broker configuration to ensure it runs as a singleton job. Please note that this fix may result in the VMs Availability Zones (AZs) being changed. This only affects the Shared-VM. As a result, there is a possibility of an orphaned disk occurring. If this happens, please refer to https://bosh.io/docs/persistent-disks/#orphaned-disks for instructions on how to reattach the disk.

* **loggr-syslog-agent Drain Certificate:** Added `drain_ca.crt` to broker so `loggr-syslog-agent` can pull the certificate for trust.

* **Ruby Buildpack in Smoke Test Errand:** Smoke Tests Errand no longer fails with Ruby Buildpack 1.9.x and 1.10.x.
